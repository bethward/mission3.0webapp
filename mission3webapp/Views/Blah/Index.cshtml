<h1>Hello! My name is Bethany Ward.</h1>
<br />
<br />
<p>I am really enjoying IS 413. I am eager to see if I enjoy web app development in ASP.NET. I am not very sure what specific careers I would like to pursue, so I am enjoying the exposure to many different skills. I hope to learn how to better problem solve and dive into projects or challenges that I don't already know how to fix!</p>
<br />
<p>I love going on walks with my husband!</p>
